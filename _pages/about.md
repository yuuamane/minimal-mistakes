Hey. I'm Faaez Razeen. I'm a 20 year old final year undergraduate student studying CS at [BSACIST](https://crescent.education). 

I came into Computer Science at a later point than most. Up until I started my admissions process for my undergraduate degree, I didn't even know what CS was. All I learned in school was about basic computer skills and the Microsoft suite of tools. After multiple sessions of googling, I decided to start learning Python. I started with Zed Shaw's Learn Python The Hard Way. For a while, I was really into it as coding was an entirely new experience. At a point I got frustrated since Zed asks us to copy his code verbatim- which might be a good way for some people to learn but after a point I got frustrated.  I stopped learning until I came to college and was introduced to the *wonderful* world of C Programming.

I joined two weeks late than my fellow classmates. On my first ever lab class, I was thrown in and asked to code a simple program. If my memory serves right, it was a simple program for calculating simple interest. I never knew an iota of C, and I distinctly remember copying code from a person who was sitting beside me, and typing `#include<studio.h>` instead of `#include<stdio.h>` and wondering what the heck a studio had to do with any of this. After some good old Bucky Robert tutorials, I was solid on the basics and went from there. 

From this point, programming was never an issue for me, atleast not at the level the pedagogy was at my institute. Many would be satisfied to just get a compiled program without errors but I would never give up without a fight. The only ever program to defeat me was a partition allocation method program for my Operating Systems laboratory. The thrill of getting the correct output and walking out early out of the exam room had it's own charm.

Throughout my years in college, I experimented with many languages and many domains. I've written programs in C, C++, Java, Python, queried databases using SQL, made small CRUD applications using the LAMP stack, made very (*very*) basic Android applications, and eventually made my own landing page for my website using pure HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I never became proficient in any of these due to my multiple experimentations (*thank you, my curious brain*), but I've learned something along the way and I'm happy that I got to try these before settling on something to get good at. 

At this point, I'm still struck between two things to have a career in- data science and software engineering. While the prospect extracting useful information from a pile of seemingly useless data seems  



From the stars,
